## Silex instances by Silex Labs

This instance is a fork of the [Silex editor](https://github.com/silexlabs/editor.silex.me) wich implements [`silex-puter` plugin](https://github.com/silexlabs/silex-puter) in order to serve Silex to puter users with the puter integration.

This repo holds the code for the [public Silex instance hosted for free by Silex Labs foundation](https://puter.silex.me) and [The v3 instance too](https://v3.silex.me).

This is also a good example on how to customize Silex. And it has a Dockerfile for easy deployment
